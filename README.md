# Data Visualisation
This repository contains assignments done for my Data Visualisation module in Trinity College Dublin.

## Assignment 1.2:

OBJECTIVE: Recreate Minard’s visualization of Napolean’s Russian Campaign using graphical programming. Your visualization MUST show (a) position of cities and path of army through them, (b) survivors in the army along the path, (c)
temperature during retreat. Your final output should be in the form of a mini-poster that may be printed out at A4 size; you should try to ensure that the choice of
graphical elements is optimized for the chart and related elements (such as captions) to be legible at this size

## Assignment 1.3:

Note: This is called Assignment3 above^

Part 1. Visualize the evolution of life expectancy over the years:

Encode year by x-position, and life-expectancy by y-position. Then create 3 variants of the chart, encoding the categorical attribute continent using any 3
other encoding channels of your choice; one variant of the chart for each channel. It is optional to visualize the remining attributes

Part 2: Visualize the correlation between wealth and health: 

Encode gdp by x-position and life expectancy by y-position. Then create 3 variants of the charts that encode population using any 3 other encoding
channels. It is optional to visualize the remining attributes

Part 3: free form :

Create a single visualization that somehow, encodes all 6 attributes in one chart
